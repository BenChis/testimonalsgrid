## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

First time I used a Grit layout instead of a flexbox. It is another way to think about your layout. Grit is an amazing way to organize your layout 2 dimensional. I accomplished everything I knew before about grit to use in this challenge.


```
```css

.lineBreak {
    display: inline;
}
.lineBreak::before {
    content: "\a ";
    white-space: pre;
}


A  CSS rule to change the make a line-break!

### Continued development

In future projects I will continue to start mixing layouts and try to add some more animation. I am very keen on how fat you can go in CSS.
